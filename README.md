# ATM-Controller
Implementation of a simple ATM controller.

## This project was created using IntelliJ and can be cloned directly from GitHub.
Run the file ATMControllerTest in the test directory to test the ATMController class.
There are three text files (query.txt, testInput.txt, testPin.txt) that are read to simulate user input during testing.
query.txt: A single integer value specifying the amount of money to be withdrawn or deposited.
testInput.txt: Read by ATMControllerTest for testing.
testPin.txt: A single integer value simulating the user's PIN input.
