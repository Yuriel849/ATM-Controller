A simulation of a real-life ATM.

## "old" directory
A shelved first attempt at a simple ATM controller.
#### This project was created using IntelliJ and can be cloned directly from GitHub.
Run the file ATMControllerTest in the test directory to test the ATMController class.<br>
There are three text files (query.txt, testInput.txt, testPin.txt) that are read to simulate user input during testing.<br>
> query.txt: A single integer value specifying the amount of money to be withdrawn or deposited. <br>
> testInput.txt: Read by ATMControllerTest for testing. <br>
> testPin.txt: A single integer value simulating the user's PIN input.
